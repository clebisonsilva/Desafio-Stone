2)     OK, mas dá para melhorar, coloquei apenas um dia específico e não um dia qualquer!
SELECT COUNT(block_numbers)

    ORDER BY COUNT(block_number) DESC;

A- 1 Pergunta:
SELECT hash, COUNT(gas_used)  
FROM bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.blocks
    GROUP BY hash
    ORDER BY COUNT(gas_used) DESC
    LIMIT 1;

B - 2 Pergunta:
SELECT tokens.address, blocks.hash
FROM tokens
INNER JOIN blocks
ON tokens.block_hash=blocks.hash
WHERE tokens.block_hash = (
SELECT hash, COUNT(gas_used)  
FROM bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.blocks
    GROUP BY hash
    ORDER BY COUNT(gas_used) DESC
    LIMIT 1);
